Operational security

so for awhile I've kinda been in tbe back room looking into online privacy and how it all works. 

so i am on to phase 3. 
which is writing guides and making any scripts which will help with this. 

which i shall place here. 
it is important to note that the guides woll help with mass privacy issues not targeted. 
if threat model is high af than speak to a professional.
